# NerdMiner — AxeHub Edition

Community fork of [BitMaker-hub/NerdMiner_v2](https://github.com/BitMaker-hub/NerdMiner_v2)
adding optional features on top of the original miner. All upstream
functionality is preserved — additions are gated behind compile flags
so you opt in only to what you want.

The bulk of the new logic lives in dedicated `axehub_*` files; upstream
files (`mining.cpp`, `monitor.cpp`, `wManager.cpp`, `NerdMinerV2.ino.cpp`,
display drivers, …) are modified only with thin hooks needed to wire
those in. Future upstream rebases will likely need manual conflict
resolution at those hook points.

| Miner | Network | TimeChart |
|---|---|---|
| ![Miner screen — current hashrate, uptime, pool / local best diff, workers, accepted shares](images/axehub/firmware-cyd28-bc2.jpg) | ![Network screen — coin price, NTP time, block height, halving / retarget countdown, network hashrate + difficulty](images/axehub/firmware-cyd28-network.jpg) | ![TimeChart screen — local clock + date, 24h price sparkline with min / max overlays and 24h delta %](images/axehub/firmware-cyd28-timechart.jpg) |

## What this fork adds

**`AXEHUB_API_ENABLED`** — local HTTP API on port 80 (`/api/axehub/v1/*`)
for remote monitoring and control. Full spec: [AXEHUB_API.md](AXEHUB_API.md).
Endpoints include:
- `/info` — full device snapshot (firmware / hashing / pool / hardware sections)
- `/pool/set` + `/pool/set_fallback` — change primary / fallback pool over HTTP, persisted to NVS
- `/pool/stats_api` — point the bottom-screen workers / diff / hashrate display at any custom stats URL (CKpool dashboards, public-pool, …)
- `/coin` — switch chain (`BTC` / `BC2` (BitcoinII) pre-configured, plus `custom` with per-endpoint URL overrides for any SHA-256 fork)
- `/display/{mode,brightness,sleep_window}` — cycle screens, dim TFT, schedule nightly backlight off
- `/buzzer/{test,tone}` — identify a board in a rack, custom alerts
- `/system/restart` + `/system/reset_stats` + `/wifi/reset` — soft reboot, NVS stats wipe, reprovisioning escape hatch
- `/webhook/set` — outbound push for boot / pool connect / share-above-threshold / block-found events

**`AXEHUB_DISPLAY`** — alternative TFT layout with three cyclable screens:

- **Miner** — current hashrate, uptime, pool best / local best diff, workers, accepted shares
- **Network** — coin price, NTP time, block height, halving / retarget countdown, network hashrate + difficulty
- **TimeChart** — local clock + date, 24h price sparkline (coloured per-segment by trend) with min / max overlays and 24h delta %

Two driver variants share the same screens and data plumbing:

- **CYD ESP32-2432S028R / S024** (ILI9341 320×240) — touch-cyclable, full-detail layout
- **M5StickC Plus 2** (ST7789v2 240×135) — button-cyclable (BtnA), compact layout for the small screen (Network drops `Difficulty` for space, still available via API)

Coin-aware: rendering and data sources follow the active `axhCoinTicker`
(`BTC` / `BC2` / `custom`). Screen index can be cycled via touch / button or
set explicitly through the API.

**Pool fallback** — automatic failover when the primary pool stops
responding. Configured via the HTTP API or via any client that speaks it.

**`web-flasher/`** — browser-based flasher for sideloading prebuilt
firmware without `esptool`/PlatformIO. Static site, deployable as-is to
GitHub Pages (or any static host). Requires Chrome or Edge — flashing
uses the Web Serial API, which Firefox / Safari do not implement.

## Measured hashrate

Pool-effective hashrate (accepted shares × pool difficulty / time) on a private
BC2 (BitcoinII) test pool, diff floor 0.001, 100% acceptance ratio. CPU @ 240
MHz, no overclocking. The on-screen `current_khs` counter tracks SHA peripheral
iteration speed and converges to the effective rate after a few minutes of
warm-up.

| Board                     | Chip       | Pool-effective |
|---------------------------|------------|----------------|
| ESP32-CAM                 | ESP32-D0   | **~670 kH/s**  |
| CYD 2.8 (ESP32-2432S028R) | ESP32-D0   | **~670 kH/s**  |
| CYD 2.4 (ESP32-2432S024)  | ESP32-D0   | **~670 kH/s**  |
| M5StickC Plus 2           | ESP32-PICO | **~660 kH/s**  |
| ESP32-S3 (DevKitC N16R8)  | ESP32-S3R8 | **~350 kH/s**  |

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dwespl/nerdminer-axehub.git
cd nerdminer-axehub
# the AXEHUB_* flags are already enabled in platformio.ini for the
# included envs — pick the one matching your board:
pio run -e ESP32-2432S028R     # CYD 2.8" — display + touch verified, primary target
pio run -e ESP32-2432S024      # CYD 2.4" — display verified, touch only on XPT2046 variant
pio run -e M5Stick-C-Plus2     # M5StickC Plus 2 — display verified, BtnA cycles screens
pio run -e ESP32-S3-devKitv1   # ESP32-S3 N16R8 — verified, no display
pio run -e esp32cam            # ESP32-CAM — API only (no display)

# then build + flash (always pass -e — without it PIO builds every env):
pio run -e ESP32-2432S028R --target upload   # add --upload-port COMx if PIO doesn't auto-detect
# or open web-flasher/ in Chrome/Edge to flash via USB Web Serial
```

To build a stock upstream image without these additions, remove
`-D AXEHUB_API_ENABLED=1` and `-D AXEHUB_DISPLAY=1` from the env's
`build_flags` in `platformio.ini`. The fork is purely additive — with
those flags off, the binary behaves identically to upstream.

## License

Same as upstream — MIT (see [`LICENSE`](LICENSE)). Fork additions are
released under the same terms.

## Requirements

- TTGO T-Display S3 or any supported boards (check Build tutorial 👇)
- 3D BOX [here](3d_files/)

### Project description

**ESP32 implementing Stratum protocol** to mine on solo pool. Pool can be changed but originally works with [public-pool.io](https://web.public-pool.io) (where Nerdminers are supported).

This project was initialy developed using ESP32-S3, but currently support other boards. It uses WifiManager to modify miner settings and save them to SPIFF.
The microMiner comes with several screens to monitor it's working procedure and also to show you network mining stats.
Currently includes:

- NerdMiner Screen > Mining data of Nerdminer
- ClockMiner Screen > Fashion style clock miner
- GlobalStats Screen > Global minery stats and relevant data

This miner is multicore and multithreads, both cores are used to mine and several threads are used to implementing stratum work and wifi stuff.
Every time an stratum job notification is received miner update its current work to not create stale shares.

**IMPORTANT** Miner is not seen by all standard pools due to its low share difficulty. You can check miner work remotely using specific pools specified down or seeing logs via UART.

**_Current project is still in developement and more features will be added_**

### Flash firmware

#### microMiners Flashtool [Recommended]

Easyiest way to flash firmware. Build your own miner using the folowing firwmare flash tool:

1. Get a TTGO T-display S3 or any other supported board
1. Go to NM2 flasher online: https://flasher.bitronics.store/ (recommend via Google Chrome incognito mode)

#### Standard tool

Create your own miner using the online firwmare flash tool **ESPtool** and one of the **binary files** that you will find in the `bin` folder.
If you want you can compile the entire project using Arduino, PlatformIO or Expressif IDF.

1. Get a TTGO T-display S3 or any supported board
1. Download this repository
1. Go to ESPtool online: https://espressif.github.io/esptool-js/
1. Load the firmware with the binary from one of the sub-folders of `bin` corresponding to your board.
1. Plug your board and select each file from the sub-folder (`.bin` files).

### Update firmware

Update NerdMiner firmware following same flashing steps but only using the file 0x10000_firmware.bin.

#### Build troubleshooting

1. Online [ESP Tool](https://espressif.github.io/esptool-js/) works with chrome, chromium, brave
1. ESPtool recommendations: use 115200bps
1. Build errors > If during firmware download upload stops, it's recommended to enter the board in boot mode. Unplug cable, hold right bottom button and then plug cable. Try programming
1. In extreme case you can "Erase all flash" on ESPtool to clean all current configuration before uploading firmware. There has been cases that experimented Wifi failures until this was made.
1. In case of ESP32-WROOM Boards, could be necessary to put your board on boot mode. Hold boot button, press reset button and then program.

## NerdMiner configuration

After programming, you will only need to setup your Wifi and BTC address.

Note: when BTC address of your selected wallet is not provided, mining will not be started.

#### Wifi Accesspoint


1. Connect to NerdMinerAP
   - AP: NerdMinerAP
   - PASS: MineYourCoins
1. Set up your Wifi Network
1. Add your BTC address
1. Change the password if needed

   - If you are using public-pool.io and you want to set a custom name to your worker you can append a string with format _.yourworkername_ to the address


#### SD card (if available)

1. Format a SD card using Fat32.
1. Create a file named "config.json" in your card's root, containing the the following structure. Adjust the settings to your needs:  
```
{  
  "SSID": "myWifiSSID",  
  "WifiPW": "myWifiPassword",  
  "PoolUrl": "public-pool.io",  
  "PoolPort": 21496,
  "PoolPassword": "x",
  "BtcWallet": "walletID",  
  "Timezone": 2,  
  "SaveStats": false  
}
```

1. Insert the SD card.
1. Hold down the "reset configurations" button as described below to reset the configurations and/or boot without settings in your nvmemory.
1. Power down to remove the SD card. It is not needed for mining.
